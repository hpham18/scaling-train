# Unpacking the Work: A Project Review of Unpacking Manuel's Tavern

## What is Manuel's Tavern?
### The Location
Manuel's Tavern is located just outside of downtown Atlanta, in the vibrant Decatur neighborhood. Founded in 1956, Manuel's is in essence a dive bar, but has seen countless politicans and has political relations etched into its walls, which only add to the quirkiness of the location. The founder, Manuel Maloof, once served as the chairman then chief executive of DeKalb county before passing in 2004. From time to time, Democratic politicans will come and pay their respects, such as President Barack Obama, and there are various photographs of politicans that grace the walls, such as a picture featuring President Bill Clinton and Vice President Al Gore on the left and right of Manuel Maloof himself. The tavern has a long history and the walls of the tavern are home to photographs, political stickers, jerseys, and other artifacts that most certainly have a story along with them. 
### The Project
[Unpacking Manuel's Tavern] (https://scholarblogs.emory.edu/unpackingmanuels/) is a project started by Ms. Ruth Dusseault, an artist and documentary filmmaker, and a group of academics to archive the history that lives on the walls of Manuel's Tavern. The website describes the project as an, "experimental, collaborative digital archiving project." It has 4 major phases:
1. Capturing high resolution gigapan images of the walls of the tavern
2. Creating a databse of objects on the walls
3. Making images publicly available for annotation, commentary, and research
4. Experimenting with other visualizing, like 3D renderings

Dusseault and her team envision the final product to be a gigapan photograph in which site visitors can navigate around, and click on visual artifacts to read more about the artifact and its historical component.
