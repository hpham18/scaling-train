# Unpacking the Work: A Project Review of Unpacking Manuel's Tavern

## What is Manuel's Tavern?
### The Location
Manuel's Tavern is located just outside of downtown Atlanta, in the vibrant Decatur neighborhood. Founded in 1956, Manuel's is, in essence, a dive bar but has seen countless politicians and has political relations etched into its walls, which only add to the quirkiness of the location. The founder, Manuel Maloof, once served as the chairman then chief executive of DeKalb county before passing in 2004. From time to time, Democratic politicians will come and pay their respects, such as President Barack Obama, and there are various photographs of politicians that grace the walls, such as a picture featuring President Bill Clinton and Vice President Al Gore on the left and right of Manuel Maloof himself. The tavern has a long history and the walls of the tavern are home to photographs, political stickers, jerseys, and other artifacts that most certainly have a story along with them. 
### The Project
[Unpacking Manuel's Tavern] (https://scholarblogs.emory.edu/unpackingmanuels/) is a project started by Ms. Ruth Dusseault, an artist and documentary filmmaker, and a group of academics to archive the history that lives on the walls of Manuel's Tavern. The website describes the project as an, "experimental, collaborative digital archiving project." It has 4 major phases:

1. Capturing high resolution gigapan images of the walls of the tavern
2. Creating a database of objects on the walls
3. Making images publicly available for annotation, commentary, and research
4. Experimenting with other visualizing, like 3D renderings

The project is not yet complete, but Dusseault and her team envision the final product to be a gigapan photograph in which site visitors can navigate around, and click on visual artifacts to read more about the artifact and its historical component. 

## Reviewing the Project
### Concept & Content
The purpose of the project is clearly articulated on the site, along with the phases in which the project will be carried out. The team is currently still processing images and data, so there is no actual imagery yet to be displayed. There is no argument, because the project strives to digitally document the existing visual artifacts displayed in Manuel's Tavern. The creators are not collecting the data to advance an overall argument or anything, but to display the history of this unofficial landmark location. Furthermore, because the creators are still gathering data, they are requesting for people to send in information they may have regarding a visual artifact. For instance, I may know the story of the baseball bat that is displayed in the tavern, so I would send in the story and after vetting by Manuel's historians and by educators, my story would be attached to the bat in the final gigapan photograph once the site is completed. 
### Design & Technique
Like I previously mentioned, the project is not complete so I can only critique what is listed as the soon to be design. Currently, the design of the site is well-organized and explains the project in its incomplete form. The tabs

* *"What Will It Look Like?"*
* *"How Can I Contribute?"* 
* *"We Are Also Looking For:"*
* *"For Educators"*

are clearly distinguished and make it easy to navigate the site. Furthermore, the visual images that are displayed now include a map of the tavern as well as one photo of the tavern, which are both engaging images. I believe the final form, an interactive gigapan photograph, is an innovative and unique way to display historical data. I believe this method will be extremely effective at supporting the purpose of the site. It is hard to judge if there is room for improvement, because the website is not complete. There is an advantage in this being a digital project, because the project can constantly be updated without issue, which would not be possible if the project was in a paper format, because updates would have to be reprinted and redistributed while updates made to a digital project would not have to be redistributed, rather a user would just have to refresh the webpage. 
### Collaboration & Documentation
The project not yet complete, but I know it will receive input from multiple collaborators. One, historians working on the project will vet information submitted. Two, educators are welcome to use the site and incorporate it into class lessons, allowing students the opportunity to do research and also vet information. Three, normal people who are not affiliated with education can also contribute personal narratives to add to specific artifacts or the general location itself. At this point, I do not believe the processes are well documented, outside of stating, "We are still photographing the tavern and processing images..." the website does not actively list the status of the project which can be frustrating for users who are ready for the project to get up and running. Additionally, the creators do not include an documentation on the creative process of creating the gigapan photo or the research that has been collected thus far. There is no place to list suggestions or share feedback on the project.
